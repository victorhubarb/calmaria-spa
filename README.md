## Features and Application Demonstration
- `Feature 1`: A page created applying some uses of WAI-ARIA aimed at accessibility, both when navigating the project with the keyboard and also when using text reading applications like NVDA.
- `Feature 2`: Use of modals in some fields of the page, such as the 'Entrar em contato' modal, where clicking the button opens a modal window for entering contact information. After filling out the information, another modal is displayed to confirm the completion of the process.
- `Feature 3`: Implementation of an accordion structure, where upon clicking, a new space expands providing answers to the most frequently asked questions by customers or potential customers before finalizing a purchase. The accordion allows for clicking again to close it.
- `Feature 4`: Responsive website, designed for various screen sizes.
